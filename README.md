 My name is Cassia. I am 37 years old. I come from Brazil but nowadays I am living with my husband in Darmstadt, in Germany. I am married since 2017 and I live with my husband since 2016. I like music, read books, dance, learning new languages and IT. I will begin a Bachelor Degree in Software Engineer. I am really excited to begin which will be on August of this year, 2021.
